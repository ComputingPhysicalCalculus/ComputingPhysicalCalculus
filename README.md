# Computing Physical Calculus
University of Cambridge IB group project

## Design Brief
In the days when Cambridge innovators like Turing were still inventing the
foundations of Computer Science, our department was known as the Mathematical
Laboratory, offering a wide range of computation facilities implemented using
mechanical devices. One impressive machine, the Differential Analyzer was able
to solve calculus problems. The goal of this project is to create a digital working
replica of the Differential Analyzer, which can be used both to illustrate the
elegant operation of this device, and help students to gain an intuitive understanding
of mathematical principles through the visualised behaviour.
